Open your Command Prompt, or the shell if you're on MacOS, or PowerShell,
if you've installed it, or the Windows Terminal (which I'll be using)

In Windows and MacOS you have a default user folder you can start from, usually users
slash your user name.

to make a new folder here, you can type "mkdir source" - I'm calling it this because
this is the default locaiton Visual Studio Community uses to store projects
You can use start somewhere different if you like but to make things simpler, I like
to set up mine like this.

If you've ever tried creating a project with Visual Studio Community, you should already
have a folder like this, so don't worry if you get an error message saying that folder
already exists

to open this folder, you can use the "start" command. This is used to start programs,
but it can also open folders in your default file explorer
"start source" should open the source folder
in the MacOs terminal this is "open source"

Back in the terminal, let's move the terminal location to inside that folder
that's this path we see on the left here

"CD source"

"mkdir repos"

we can now move into the repos folder

cd repos

and if we want to start this folder from inside it, we can use

start .

here, you can make a folder called "EFA", or "EFA Projects" or "EFA Foundation"
You can put separate Foundation and Immersion (or whatever) in one folder,
or create different folders. It's up to you. More folders means a more complex
file structure with longer addresses and harder to reach files, but it also makes
organization a lot easier


HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is a language that describes to web browsers
exactly how to display a web page. HTML originally just consisted of text, boxes,
and text in boxes.

HTML elements are based on the Box Model, meaning they're all basically just boxes.
With styles, you can change the color, width, height, thickness, position, and other
properties of the boxes, as well as the style of the text.

HTML styles often borrow terms from printing, since it deals with the same basic problem
fitting content onto a page in a way that looks nice and readable

Like with newspapers, HTMl styles are concerned with padding, margin, columns,
width, height, and font properties. They even use units like ems and ens, the width
of the printed letter M or N, respectively.
