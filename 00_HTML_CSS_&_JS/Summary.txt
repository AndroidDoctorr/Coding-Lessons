All of Day One's materials will be covering HTML and CSS.

We will be using Visual Studio Code for the projects today.

Inside our ElevenFiftyProjects folder we can create a new folder for the HTML work.
It's important to emphasize to the students to maintain a clean work space.

The flow today will start off by going through the 2 Truths, 1 Lie challenge (optional).
This is followed by what should be review over basic forms (form, input, button, & divs).
After this, pass out the Register Form challenge (found in Canvas) for the students to complete.
This should wrap up either right before or after lunch.
Afterwards, you can walk through deploying it to GitHub Pages if you feel so inclined (advised).
The rest of the day can be the smiley face walkthrough and assigning the CSS creature.
