This is the repository for lecture notes for Coding Foundation/Immersion (V4)

The project code from those lessons (minus the SQL content) is contained in this repo

Day 1 is focused on installs, introductions, and git, so this starts with Day 2 content
Day 2 is HTML and CSS
Day 3 is also HTML and CSS
Day 4 can introduce JS, but will most likely be needed for HTML and CSS

Week 2 introduces JS, followed by C# baiscs (01_TypesAndVariables)
