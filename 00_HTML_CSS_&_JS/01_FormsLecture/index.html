    1. Open up Visual Studio Code.
    2. Setup a new folder for the project. This folder will hold our index.html for now as the goal is to keep everything organized. For example, make an HTMLForms (or whatever naming convention you prefer) folder inside your ElevenFiftyProjects folder. Once you have this folder created, open the folder in VS Code.
    3. Inside this new folder, create an index.html file. You can do this either in the File Explorer or through VS Code (recommended). Once you have it created, scaffold out some HTML code by using the ! snippet.
    4. Now that you have your HTML file open it in your web browser. Make sure everyone has it set up so they can open it in the browser. You can demonstrate viewing the changes by updating the title tag to say "Forms Example" or something like it.
    5. Add form tag opening and closing tags. Feel free to refresh your browser to show off that the form tag doesn't display anything by itself. Ask them if they can figure out why nothing's showing up?
    6. Now that you have your form go ahead and add an input tag. For now work without a type attribute. Demonstrate the functionalities included, i.e., the ability to type in the tag and hit enter to "submit" your information.
    7. Add a second input tag, then add types (text and password or other types if you want to show them off).
    8. Add divs around the input tags which will move them to separate lines.
    9. Add a button after the input tags with the submit type.
    10. Feel free to mess around with reviewing CSS if you did not do the optional 2 Truths, 1 Lie CSS section

<!-- Step Walkthrough
    1. Scaffold HTML with ! snippet
    2. Change title tag to demonstrate updates in the browser.
    3. Add form tag by itself and then show updated browser. What changed? Why don't we see anything new? Good opportunity to discuss container tags.
    4. Add an input tag inside the form tag. Show the new changes.
    5. Add a second input tag. Now that you have two tags, go ahead and add the type attributes to both tags.
    6. Now that you have two input tags, add div tags around them to push them to separate lines.
    7. Add a button tag and discuss how the submit type would submit the form's value if it had a place to send the information. In this case, it just "resets" the form because there is nothing set up to accept the data.
