    Codepen account setup if needed. Students who went through ITC should have an account unless current ITC structure changes.

    Unlike with our Static HTML Registration Page and our 2 Truths, 1 Lie projects, Codepen does not include the html head.
    
    For the rest of the day the students can work on their Smiley Face walkthrough and then their CSS Creature.
    
    CSS Creature Day 1 Assignment - Due Tuesday (Week 1 Day 2) Morning.
    
    Students can present, or depending on class size you can have them split into groups and choose who presents from the groups.
    
    Presentations should include discussing struggles, wins, and interesting things learned and how the learning process went.
